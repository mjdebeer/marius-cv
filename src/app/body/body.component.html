  <h3>ABSA South Africa (2020 - Present)</h3>
  <p class="text-secondary"><em>I worked as part of a team on the development of a high volume collections system for a large South African bank.</em></p>
  <p>The system consists of multiple microservices and an ops dashboard. It integrates with various other systems and platforms both inside the bank and externally.</p>
  <p>Things I worked on:</p>
    <li>Development of ops dashboard for internal use (Angular, Typescript, Akita)</li>
    <li>Contributions to various microservices (Java, Spring Boot, Kubernetes)</li>
    <li> Developed a segment of the system myself, from analysis to deployment and support, under the guidance of the tech lead</li>
    <li>Used various platforms to aid in the dev)</li>

  <h3>Africa Audio Post (2016 - 2018)</h3>
  <p class="text-secondary"><em>I was employed in a mid-level managerial position overseeing recording of broadcast audio (dubbing).</em></p>
  <p>I started experimenting with Google scripts for automating tedious tasks. This would lead to more efficient recording sessions and streamlined production.</p>
  <p>The scripts would mainly make small real-time calculations based on minimal user input related to pending or completed work. The results would be displayed on a dashboard where staff can track recording progress.</p>
  <p>I also used Google scripts to add ‘formulas’ to Google Sheets.</p>
  <p>Started learning Ruby, Ruby on Rails and front-end development.</p>
  <p>Discovered WordPress and built a website for the studio. (They have replaced it since)</p>

  <h3>AEMG Studios (2019 - 2020)</h3>
  <p class="text-secondary"><em>I am currently employed in a senior managerial position, reporting to the CEO.</em></p>
  <p>At AEMG I put together a similar system to the one we used at Africa Audio Post. Ultimately my goal was to build a web application with a JS framework to replace the Google Sheets system (which is why I decided to focus heavily on sharpening my Javascript skills). I learnt a lot about solving complex data problems with code.</p>
  <p>The current system uses Google scripts and formulas to complete various tasks, for example:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Calculate totals to display on overview pages</li>
    <li>Process data for staff performance monitoring</li>
    <li>
      <p>Process form data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create Artist Sheet inside “Artists” spreadsheet </li>
        <li>Name the sheet according to form input</li>
        <li>Generate and add an ID to the sheet</li>
        <li>Add the form data to an overview sheet</li>
        <li>Add a link to the Artist Sheet in the new row on the overview sheet</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>I used the opportunity to try different ways of structuring data and test out what works the most intuitively. I also built a   <a href="http://aemg.africa/aemgweb/">website </a>for this studio. This one is just static.</p>
  <p>While working at AEMG I was able to broaden my web development skills a lot through various online and other resources. </p>
